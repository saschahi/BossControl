Boss Controll lets you disable Bosses of your choosing.

Go into "YOURUSERFOLDER\Dokuments\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mod Configs"
and open "Boss Controll.json" with a Texteditor of your Choice to Configure this mod.

If you choose to add more mods, this mod will automatically put the new Bosses into the config-list.

And don't worry. the Config won't break if you remove a Mod that adds a Boss

NOTE: To enable/disable bosses you need to restart the game. I'm working on it to reload the config on Mod Reload.

NOTE2: Some Bosses come in multiple parts. It's advised to disable all parts of a single boss to reduce buginess.

ToDo:
- Tidy up some Code
- Add the ability to disable events
- Make the Config Reload without restarting the game/server

V0.1
- Made the Mod Operable
